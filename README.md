# Mesh MQTT Server

A Meshtastic-aware MQTT server designed for the Western PA Mesh network. This server provides enhanced MQTT capabilities with Meshtastic protocol support, user authentication, and a web interface for mesh network management.

## Features

- **Meshtastic Protocol Support**: Native support for Meshtastic mesh networking protocol
- **MQTT Broker**: Built-in MQTT broker with custom hooks for mesh packet processing
- **User Authentication**: OAuth2 integration (Discord) with session management
- **Web Interface**: Dashboard for viewing nodes and network status
- **PostgreSQL Backend**: Persistent storage for nodes, users, and OAuth tokens
- **Packet Encryption**: AES-CTR (PSK) and AES-CCM with Curve25519 (PKI) encryption
- **Node Management**: Automatic node detection, tracking, and database persistence
- **Gateway Support**: Advanced gateway topic handling with permission-based access control
- **Downlink Verification**: Validates bidirectional communication with mesh nodes

## Requirements

- Go 1.24.3 or later
- PostgreSQL database
- Discord OAuth application (for authentication)

## Configuration

Create a `config.yml` file with the following structure:

```yaml
ListenAddr: ":8080"
SessionSecret: "your-session-secret-here"
BaseURL: "https://your-domain.com"

OAuth:
  Discord:
    ClientID: "your-discord-client-id"
    ClientSecret: "your-discord-client-secret"
    Endpoint:
      AuthURL: "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize"
      TokenURL: "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token"
    RedirectURL: "https://your-domain.com/auth/discord/callback"
    Scopes:
      - identify

MeshSettings:
  MqttRoot: "msh/US/2/e/"
  Channels:
    - Name: "LongFast"
      Key: "AQ=="  # Base64 encoded channel key
  SelfNode:
    NodeID: "!12345678"
    LongName: "Western PA Mesh Server"
    ShortName: "WPAMesh"

Database:
  User: "postgres"
  Password: "your-db-password"
  Host: "localhost:5432"
  DB: "mesh_mqtt"
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:kabili207/mesh-mqtt-server.git
cd mesh-mqtt-server
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

3. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the configuration file

4. Build the server:
```bash
go build -o mesh-mqtt-server ./cmd/server
```

## Usage

Run the server with the default config file:
```bash
./mesh-mqtt-server
```

Or specify a custom config file:
```bash
./mesh-mqtt-server -c /path/to/config.yml
```

The server will:
- Start the MQTT broker on port 1883
- Start the web interface on the configured `ListenAddr`
- Automatically run database migrations
- Begin processing mesh packets

## MQTT Connection

Connect to the MQTT broker at `localhost:1883` (or your configured address). The server supports standard MQTT clients and includes Meshtastic-specific packet handling.

## Web Interface

Access the web interface at your configured `BaseURL` to:
- View all mesh nodes
- See your registered nodes
- Monitor network activity

## Advanced Features

### Gateway Topic Support

The server implements intelligent gateway topic handling designed to maintain a healthy, LoRa-first mesh network while still providing MQTT connectivity for isolated users.

**Why Restrict Gateway Access?**

Unlike the public Meshtastic MQTT network (which uses a zero-hop strategy to prevent MQTT from overwhelming the mesh), the Western PA Mesh's challenging, hilly geography requires a different approach:

- **LoRa-First Priority**: The mesh should primarily operate over LoRa radio, not depend on internet connectivity
- **Hop Preservation**: Packets must traverse the mesh without hop count modification to reach isolated users across difficult terrain
- **Routing Stability**: Unrestricted MQTT access can create routing issues, especially when uplink and downlink paths aren't symmetrical
- **Strategic Gateway Placement**: By carefully limiting which nodes can act as gateways, we bridge larger city/county regions to isolated nodes without creating a mesh dependent on internet backhaul

**Gateway vs Non-Gateway Nodes:**

- **Gateway Nodes**: Authorized to publish packets that will be relayed over LoRa with preserved hop counts. These are strategically placed to connect regions while maintaining mesh health.
- **Non-Gateway Nodes**: Can still connect via MQTT for monitoring and network mapping, but their messages won't be relayed to LoRa. This helps visualize the full network without creating routing issues.

**Topic Format:**
```
msh/region/Gateway/2/e/channel/nodeID  # Gateway-enabled nodes
msh/region/2/e/channel/nodeID          # Standard topic (auto-rewritten for non-gateway)
```

**Permission System:**
- Gateway access is permission-based and stored in the database
- Users without gateway permission have their topics automatically rewritten to standard format
- The server validates both user permissions and node roles before allowing gateway features
- Prevents asymmetric routing scenarios that can destabilize mesh connectivity

### Downlink Verification

The server includes a downlink verification system to ensure bidirectional communication with mesh nodes, which is critical for gateway-enabled nodes:

**How It Works:**
1. When a node connects using a gateway topic, the server sends a NodeInfo request packet
2. The server tracks the verification packet ID and waits for a response
3. When the node responds to the request, the verification timestamp is updated in the database
4. Nodes are periodically re-verified to ensure ongoing connectivity

**Verification States:**
- **Unverified**: Node has never responded to a verification request
- **Verified**: Node has recently responded (timestamp stored in database)
- **Expiring Soon**: Verification is older than threshold, re-verification triggered
- **Pending**: Verification request sent, awaiting response

**Why This Matters:**
- Confirms the node can receive downlink messages (not just send uplink)
- Validates that gateway-enabled nodes have symmetric routing before allowing them to inject packets into the LoRa mesh
- Helps identify nodes with asymmetric connectivity that could cause routing issues
- Prevents misconfigured clients from disrupting mesh operations

**Configuration:**
Verification happens automatically for nodes using gateway topics. The server sends packets as its configured `SelfNode` identity with the CLIENT_MUTE role to avoid interfering with normal mesh operations.

### Access Control

The server implements role-based access control (ACL) for all MQTT operations:

- **Superusers**: Full access to all topics including `$SYS` system topics
- **Gateway-Enabled Mesh Devices**: Can publish packets that will be relayed over LoRa (requires permission + verification)
- **Non-Gateway Mesh Devices**: Can publish for monitoring/mapping purposes; messages not relayed to LoRa
- **Non-Mesh Clients**: Read-only access (useful for monitoring applications and network visualization)
- **Permission Caching**: Permissions are cached with TTL to reduce database load
